- Explain the benefits of Object Oriented Programming
- Explain the principles of Object-Oriented Design
- Demonstrate Classes 
- Demonstrate Instances 
- Demonstrate `__init__`
- Demonstrate instance method
- Demonstrate the `self` keyword 
- Stretch Goals
    - Demonstrate object properties
    - Demonstrate mass assignment during Class instantiation


## What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ?
- Programming that is oriented around data rather than functionality. 
- Based on the concept of objects containing data, attributes, properties and procedures, functions and methods


## Principle of Object Oriented Programming
- Single Responsibility / Separation of Concerns (ex. Pet class and Owner class)
- Abstraction / DRY Principle
- Domain Modeling


## Benefits of Object Oriented Programming
- Modularity - Easier Troubleshooting
- Inheritance - Reusability of Code
- Scalability - Easier to Build Out
